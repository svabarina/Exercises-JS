+++ Add a span to an HTML page and style it to appear like a button 
(make its background color green).

+ Add a listener for click events to the button so that when the button is clicked, 
an image of your choosing is displayed below the button.

The image may be present in the mark-up before the button is clicked, but should be hidden 
from view.
- add an event listener for click on the image so it will hide the image when it's clicked

- add another span styled as a button which will remove the image from the page on click
(make its background color red). Donâ€™t forget to remove the event handler attached to the
image!

- add a validation to the first event listener so if the image isn't found on the page,
will alert "image does not exist"
