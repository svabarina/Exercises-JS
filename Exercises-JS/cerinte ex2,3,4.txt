Exercise 2
== use exercise 1 as base ==
- add an event listener on the body which will console.log the target and currentTarget
of the event and alerts: “Something was clicked”
Questions:
How can I make that when the green button is clicked nothing gets logged to the console?
If I leave the solution from the first question in place, what can I do to have the handler
of the body called anyway? (observe the order)

In its event handler trigger the green button’s click event.
